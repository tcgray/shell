# shell
A fun project where I emulated a Linux shell that can take in built-in Linux commands and custom functions but instead, the arguments are in reverse.

For example, "ls -l" would be typed in as "-l ls". Supports output redirection via "<*" instead of ">" and has some commands such as listchildprocs() which lists PIDs generated from the previous 20 arguments, and backgrounding and foregrounding a process
